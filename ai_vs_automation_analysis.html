      <h1>A Comparative Analysis on the Impact of AI and Automation </h1>
      <p class="post-date">Posted in 2023 </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The two professions I have chosen to analyse are ophthalmologists and
        Agricultural labourers. These professions are very different but both are likely to be
        affected by automation and artificial intelligence.</p>

        <h2>Risk of Automation</h2>

      <p>

        First, let's decide which of these two professions has a higher chance of AI and
        automation. An agricultural labourer, coming under the Agricultural and forestry
        department, is at a very high risk of Automation, based on the key findings of the
        OECD1
        . Let's say the agricultural labourer is responsible for mowing and sowing the
        seeds. The automation market is quite advanced now. We know that robots and
        high-end machines can automate this task by mowing and sowing the soil, reducing the
        time taken and labour involved. If it took one person to mow and one person to sow a
        certain-sized field to grow crops, now that would be replaced by machines. This
        technology can replace human labour, making jobs in this sector less stable. While
        employment increased in almost all occupations between 2012-20191
        , there was less
        growth in the agriculture sector and other high risk sectors. This also meant that jobs in
        this sector are also less stable- you never know when the job would get replaced by a machine. 
        Another interesting statistic of the OECD findings was that low-educated
        people not only had slower job growth but were also associated with high-risk jobs.
      </p>

      <p> 
        Does this automation take-away jobs? Yes and no. While automation can lead to
        job losses in some sectors, it can also create new job opportunities in others. However,
        these new jobs may require different skills and qualifications, and those who do not
        have the necessary skills may struggle to find employment. We discussed how a
        machine could replace two people working in the field. But this machine also opens the
        door to two different jobs- one would be a technician and the other an operator. The
        technician would be responsible for maintenance and operator for operating the
        machine. In some cases, the job of the operator might be replaced when the machine is
        advanced but that would also mean we require highly skilled technicians. Moreover, the
        development of new agriculture technologies would require skilled workers who can
        design, program, and repair these systems. This can lead to an increase in demand for
        workers with technological and engineering expertise. This is not a new trend. Over the
        years, when new technological advancements took away jobs, they also created new
        jobs. Hence, workers need to reskill and upgrade their skills to remain employable. It
        seems that there isn't much scope for people aspiring to do agricultural jobs, but
        upgrading their skills can help them get better jobs. The new jobs created in this area
        may require basic digital, technology, design, and maintenance skills. Other skills
        required, especially for managerial roles, would be leadership, communication, and the
        ability to train others. Out of all, adaptability and continuous learning skills are the most
        important as the field is expanding and to stay on track these are required. It makes this
        field interesting for newer generations as they might be interested in using new
        technologies. On the other hand, this can be difficult for agricultural labourers as these
        professions are less educated and would be hard to access new resources to upskill.
        This can lead to income inequality. New jobs created might not pay enough and expand
        this inequality.


      </p>


      <p>
        An Ophthalmologist, i.e. a doctor specializing in Eye is a part of the healthcare
        industry. Based on the key finding of the OECD2
        , health professionals and the
        healthcare industry are at very low risk of automation. The field of optometry has a 14%
        chance of being automated. The ophthalmologist profession might not be affected
        directly by this. That is, some jobs in this field like web sales, online eye vision
        assessments and refactoring are already getting automated. It is only a matter of years
        before automated refraction could be common, and could be connected to 3-D printers
        and print out glasses in seconds3
        . In any way, people aspiring to be ophthalmologists or
        enter this field would be expected to have high literacy, research, digital and tech skills.
        They would also be expected to have empathy-related skills and the ability to train and
        work with others. Adaptability and learning skills are highly expected.

      </p>

<h2>Public Trust and Ethical Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Another important factor to consider would be people's trust. Would customers
        trust rice produced on an automated farm? Yes! The rice milling machinery is expected
        to grow by a CAGR of 2.30% between 2021-254
        , indicating that it is becoming more
        successful in the market. And, how many times do we wonder if the rice in our plates
        was produced by machines? Does it change anything-no, unless there is harm being
        added? However, would patients trust and accept getting their eyes treated by a robot
        ophthalmologist? Or this could be an ethical implication, should machines be allowed to
        make decisions that affect human lives, such as medical diagnoses? AI and robots are
        what it is fed. The algorithms used in these decisions may be biased or flawed, which
        could be dangerous. Based on a survey conducted by Mindshare5 In the UK, only 11%
        of people would prefer getting medical advice from a robot. While AI and Automation
        are increasingly developing, it doesn't seem like they would replace human doctors so
        quickly as people don't seem to trust them. There is a human element that can't be
        replaced by AI and Automation. The emotion and feelings of empathy and trust cannot
        be replicated by technology. The OECD findings also showed an increase in job growth
        in this sector. This is where AI could come into the picture. It is said that AI would help in
        professional decision making leading to minimising medical mistakes in client
        treatments. This also means new technologies and skills would be required to use them.
        
      </p> 
      <h2>Regional and Economic Factors</h2>

      <p>
        While agricultural labourers are at high risk of automation in general, the risks
        and statistics would vary based on the economic situation of an area or country. A
        third-world, low-developing country might not have enough resources to get high-end
        machinery for labourer replacements or resources to educate their workforce and shift
        the job market. Ophthalmologists in rural areas might not have advanced AI technology
        to help them in their tasks.
        
      </p> 
          
      <p>

        Also, the impact of automation on a particular profession can vary depending on
        factors such as economic conditions, availability of technology, and the level of
        education and training of the workforce. In third-world and developing countries where
        resources are scarce, the shift towards automation in the agricultural sector might be
        slower. Farmers may not have the means to invest in expensive machinery, and the
        workforce might not have the necessary skills and education to transition to new jobs. In
        these cases, the risk of job automation is low and human labour would still be required.
        Similarly, in rural areas where access to advanced technology is limited,
        ophthalmologists might not have AI tools to help them as compared to those in urban
        areas.



      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In both of these professions, the risks and benefits of technological
        advancements must be considered. While AI and automation have the potential to
        change these fields and create new jobs, it also changes the jobs and creates new skills
        requirements. Hence, it is important for workers to be adaptable and continuously learn
        new skills to stay relevant in the changing job market
